# pipelines-demo
A repository holding a few openshift-pipelines demos leveraging securesign repositories to demostrate basic Secure Supply Chain practices.

These demos are bassed off of [Introduction to Secure Supply Chain](https://blog.stderr.at/securesupplychain/2023-06-15-securesupplychain-intro/) Tekton Demo written by Thomas Jungbauer, so many thanks to him.

There are three specific examples this repository attempts to demonstrate. 

01_ gitsign verify pipeline

02_

03_

Dependencies: These tutorials require an openshift cluster with openshift pipelines already installed.

This commit must be made with gitsign.
